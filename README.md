Tentmakers Coding School
========================

Welcome to the Tentmakers coding school! Want to hear a quick story...?

Two years ago, a friend and I prayed that God would open a door and provide someome to mentor us in programming. Fast forward one week, and a man whom we had never talked to introduced himself to us at a church meeting and asked if we were interested in starting a programming group. This became Project Sputnik, our first coding school.

* Fast foward three-hundred and sixty-four days, and I get hired as a programmer at Ansible.
* Fast forward six more months and my friend gets hired as a developer at Caktus.

...I think that it's really interesting that God was early by one day. In programming, there's this thing called an ["off by one error"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error)... what did God mean by this...?

....

This fall, we plan on offering a second iteration of coding school. It will be a couse that covers the following:
* An introduction to basic programming principles: "if" statements, "for" loops, etc.
* The Python language and other industry tools such as Git and Trello.
* Weekly meetings for three months and group projects.

Our course will be modelled after your typical Computer Science 101 course taught at university.

Instructors
===========

* [Christopher Wang](https://github.com/simfarm) graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in mathematics and economics and worked as an analyst in both the public and private sectors before transitioning to programming. Christopher currently works at Ansible as a test automation engineer.
* [Dmitriy Chukhin](https://github.com/dchukhin) graduated from the University of Maryland with a double major in mathematics and education and UNC-Chapel Hill with a master's degree in education and worked as a public school teacher before getting involved with Project Sputnik. Dmitriy currently works as a back-end developer at Caktus.

Why Programming?
================

A few quick reasons to consider programming as a profession:
* Programming is one of the few trades still in existence. If you are a talented programmer, then no one cares if you went to university or not. Programmers are well [compensated](http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Web_Developer/Salary)!
* Programers enjoy incredible flexibility. Ten percent of programmers work from home and even those that do not have the ability to work from home much of the time. Combine this with missions, and you could become a self-supported missionary in any place in the world with internet access!
