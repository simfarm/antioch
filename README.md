{Flaffy-Moof} Coding School
=========================

Welcome to the {Flaffy-Moof} coding school! Want to hear a quick story...?

Two years ago, a friend and I were working dead-end job and prayed that God would open a door and provide someome to mentor us in programming so that we could eventually switch jobs. Fast forward one week, and a man whom we had never talked to before introduced himself to us at a church party and asked if we were interested in starting a programming group. This became Project Sputnik, our first coding school.

* Fast foward three-hundred and sixty-four days, and then I got hired as a programmer at Ansible.
* Fast forward six more months into the future and my friend got hired as a developer at Caktus.

...I think that it's really interesting that God was early by one day. In programming, there's this thing called an "off by one error"... what does this mean?

....

This fall, we plan on offering a second iteration of coding school. It will be a couse that covers the following:
* An introduction to basic programming principles: if statements, for loops, etc.
* The Python language and other industry tools such as Git and Trello.
* Weekly meetings for three months and group projects.

Our course will be modelled after your typical Computer Science 101 course taught at university.

Instructors
===========

* [Christopher Wang](https://github.com/simfarm) graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in mathematics and economics and worked as an analyst in both the public and private sectors before transitioning to programming. Chris currently works at Ansible as a test automation engineer.
* [Dmitriy Chukhin](https://github.com/dchukhin) graduated from the University of Maryland with a double major in mathematics and education and UNC-Chapel Hill with a master's degree in education and worked as a public school teacher before getting involved with Project Sputnik. Dmitriy currently works as a back-end developer at Caktus.

Why Programming?
================

A few quick reasons to consider programming as a profession:
* Programming is one of the few trades still in existence. If you are a talented programmer, then no one cares if you went to university or not. Entry-level programmers typically start at sixty thousand!
* Programers enjoy incredible flexibility. Ten percent of programmers work from home and even those that do not have the ability to work from home much of the time. Combine this with missions, and you could become a self-supported missionary in any place in the world with internet access!

Programming is fun! Solve interesting puzzles and make tools that change the world... immense power as at your fingertips.
