# Challenge! Create the following functions:
# 1) A function that determines if a number is prime
# 2) A function that determines whether the sum of its individual digits exceeds their product
# For instance, the sum of the numbers in 87 is 15 and their product is 54
# 3) A function that determines if something will float. Acceptable params for this function: mass and volume.
# 4) A function that determines how much money you will have in n years given an initial deposit and an interest rate.
# For instance, depositing 100$ at 5% interest interest rate will give you 105$ in one year, 110.25$ in two years, etc.
