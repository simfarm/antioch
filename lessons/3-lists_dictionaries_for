# Tentmakers: Lesson 3 
# Topics covered: lists, dictionaries, for
#

#
# Lists: basic examples
#

# A list of strings
backpack = ["eraser", "books", "laptop"]

# A list of differently-typed objects
objects = ["string", 3, 3.5, False, []]

#
# List indexing: a basic example
#

backpack = ["eraser", "books", "laptop"]

>>> backpack[0]
'eraser'
>>> backpack[1]
'books'
>>> backpack[2]
'laptop'
>>> backpack[3]

# List methods
#

# Add an element to a list
basketball_team = ["center", "power forward", "small forward", "shooting guard", "point guard"]
basketball_team.append("recruit")

>>> print basketball_team
['center', 'power forward', 'small forward', 'shooting guard', 'point guard', 'recruit']

# Remove an element from a list
basketball_team.remove("center")

>>> print basketball_team
['power forward', 'small forward', 'shooting guard', 'point guard', 'recruit']

#
# Dictionaries: "key-value" pairs
# Some basic examples
#

# Here's a dictionary of grocery items and their prices
grocery_inventory = {"milk": 3.24, "cliff bar": 1.10, "cheese": 4.50, "juice": 3.20}

# Here's a dictionary using our basketball team example again
basketball_team = {"center": "Kennedy Meeks", "power forward": "Brice Johnson", "small forward": "Justin Jackson", "shooting guard": "Kenny Williams", "point guard": "Marcus Paige"} 

#
# Dictionaries: how to use
#

# Get a value given a key
>>> print basketball_team["center"]
Kennedy Meeks

# Add a key-value pair to your dictionary
>>> basketball_team["recruit"] = "Seventh Woods"
>>> print basketball_team
{'point guard': 'Marcus Paige', 'center': 'Kennedy Meeks', 'shooting guard': 'Kenny Williams', 'recruit': 'Seventh Woods', 'power forward': 'Brice Johnson', 'small forward': 'Justin Jackson'}

# Delete a key-value pair... let's say Seventh Woods decommmits (leaves the team)
>>> del basketball_team['recruit']
>>> print basketball_team
{'point guard': 'Marcus Paige', 'center': 'Kennedy Meeks', 'shooting guard': 'Kenny Williams', 'power forward': 'Brice Johnson', 'small forward': 'Justin Jackson'}

# Update a key-value pair... let's say that Brice Johnson gets injured
basketball_team["power forward"] = "Isaiah Hicks"

>>> print basketball_team
{'point guard': 'Marcus Paige', 'center': 'Kennedy Meeks', 'shooting guard': 'Kenny Williams', 'power forward': 'Isaiah Hicks', 'small forward': 'Justin Jackson'}

#
# Dictionary methods
#

>>> basketball_team.keys()
['point guard', 'small forward', 'center', 'shooting guard', 'power forward']
>>> basketball_team.values()
['Marcus Paige', 'Justin Jackson', 'Kennedy Meeks', 'Kenny Williams', 'Brice Johnson']

#
# For: for iterating over a list
# Some basic examples
#

# Just print the numbers in your list
>>> numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
>>> for number in numbers:
...     print number
... 
1
3
5
7
9
>>> 

# Increase prices by 10%
grocery_inventory = {"milk": 3.24, "cliff bar": 1.10, "cheese": 4.50, "juice": 3.20}

>>> for item in grocery_inventory:
...     grocery_inventory[item] = 1.1 * grocery_inventory[item]
... 
>>> print grocery_inventory
{'cliff bar': 1.21, 'cheese': 4.95, 'milk': 3.564, 'juice': 3.52}

# Print 00-99 by using two for loops    
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:
...     for j in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:
...             print i,j

# Basically, the syntax is as follows:

for {{placeholder variable name}} in {{iterable}}:
    {{do something}}     

# {{Basically, pick whatever you want for {{paceholder variable name}}
# {{iterable}} ==> an object-type that can be iterated over in Python.
# Lists, dictionaries, strings are all iterable.
