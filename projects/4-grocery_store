# Tentmakers: Lesson 4-grocery_store 
# Topics covered: lists, dictionaries, loops, for 
#

# Create a virtual grocery store! Grocery store should be able to:
# * Add items to cart
# * Remove items from cart
# * See items in your cart 
# * Check out your order

# For added challenge:
# * Add in the ability to apply a universal discout (20% off--for instance) to your entire order
# * Add in the ability to apply item-specific discounts (20% off milk, for instance)
# * To see the current value of all items in your cart
# * To write the entire program using functions
# * To write a really expansive grocery-store inventory
# * To make your grocery store pleasing aesthetically 

# A simple (and incomplete) construction
