# Tentmakers: Lesson 
# Topics covered: functions 
#

# Try to create the following functions. If you have time, try the challenge problems. 
# Please remember to syntax your code as demonstrated below. Test all functions with
# a demonstration.

# Tier one: create the following functions:
# 1) Circumference of a circle
# 2) Area of a rectangle
# 3) Area of a square
# 4) Area of a trapezoid
# 5) A function that returns that average of a list of numbers
# 6) A function that returns the median of a list of numbers
# 7) A function that returns the mode of a list of numbers

# Challenge! Create the following functions:
# 1) A function that determines if a number is prime
# 2) A function that determines whether the sum of its individual digits exceeds their product
# For instance, the sum of the numbers in 87 is 15 and their product is 54
# 3) A function that determines if something will float. Acceptable params for this function: mass and volume.
# 4) A function that determines how much money you will have in n years given an initial deposit and an interest rate.
# For instance, depositing 100$ at 5% interest interest rate will give you 105$ in one year, 110.25$ in two years, etc.

# A simple construction
