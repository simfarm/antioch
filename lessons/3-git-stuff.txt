# Tentmakers: Lesson 3
# Topics covered: Git, Github
#

#
# Git is a version control system for code,
# meaning that it keeps track of lots of files of code,
# who's done what changes, and when.
#
# Some reasons it's useful:
#    - allows many people to work on a project at the same time
#    - record of all of the files in the project, who wrote them, edited them, and when
#    - much easier to share files than email, etc.

  PART I: Installing Git
==========================
This depends on your operating system, but we will help you with this.

  PART II: Getting a Git project
==========================

# git clone <repository URL>
#
# This is the first thing to do when you want to get a repository onto your
# computer. Get the repository url from the repository website, 
# such as https://github.com/simfarm/tentmakers.git and run
# git clone https://github.com/simfarm/tentmakers.git
#

$ git clone https://github.com/simfarm/tentmakers.git

# git checkout <branch name>
# Each project can have lots of branches to work on, and whenever you start
# a new piece of work it's a good idea to checkout a new branch for it.
# To checkout the make_volume branch run git checkout new_volume

$ git checkout new_volume

# If you want to make a new branch, then you will need to add a '-b' before the branch name

$ git checkout -b new_volume



# git add <filename>
#
# work on a file, write some code to it, save it, and now you're ready to start
# sending it to Github to let other people see it. We will need to add the file,
# then commit a message, then push the file. To add a file called new_file.py run
# git add new_file.py

$ git add new_file.py




# git commit -m <message>
#
# After adding a file it's a good idea to write a message to summarize the work
# you've done. To tell people that new_file.py has a new volume() function you
# wrote, run git commit -m 'added new volume() function'

$ git commit -m 'added new volume() function'




# git push origin <branch name>
#
# The last thing to get your new code to Github is pushing it from your computer
# to Github. To push all of your work from the new_volume branch run
# git push origin new_volume

$ git push origin new_volume



# git pull origin <branch name>
#
# To get the latest code from a branch you can run git pull origin <branch name>
# This will get whatever code other people have pushed onto the branch onto
# your computer. To pull down the latest code from the new_volume branch run
# git pull origin new_volume

$ git pull origin new_volume
From https://github.com/simfarm/tentmakers
 * branch            new_volume     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.



# git status
#
# To figure out the status of which branch you're on, which files you've edited
# run git status.

$ git status
# On branch new_volume
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   new_file.py
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
